A Network Packet Analyzer is a tool used to capture, inspect, and analyze network traffic. It helps you understand what data is flowing through your computer or network.

What Does a Network Packet Analyzer Do?
1. It captures data packets that travel through your network and shows:
2. Source IP Address – where the data came from
3. Destination IP Address – where the data is going
4. Protocol – like TCP, UDP, ICMP (e.g., for web, file transfer, messaging)
5. Payload Data – the actual message or content inside the packet
